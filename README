yellow: generic identifiers
orange: keywords (bold) and special identifiers (normal)
red: constants
pink: variables (grey for parameters)
purple: functions
teal: classes (light cyan for type parameters)
light green: predefined identifiers
light yellow: namespaces

Different font styles are used for modifiers:

For objects:
bold: global
italic: member
bold italic: static member

For classes:
bold: normal classes

non-bold: type aliases
